            Often considered the father of modern computer science, Alan Turing was famous for his work developing the first modern computers, decoding the encryption of German Enigma machines during the second world war, and detailing a procedure known as the Turing Test, forming the basis for artificial intelligence.

            Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, UK. He displayed exceptional mathematical talent from a young age. He attended King's College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics.

            In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation. This simple yet powerful abstract machine laid the foundation for the development of modern computers and is considered one of the key insights in the history of computer science.

            Alan Turing played a pivotal role in World War II through his work in codebreaking and cryptography, particularly at Bletchley Park, the British codebreaking center. His contributions were instrumental in helping the Allied forces decipher encrypted German messages and gain crucial intelligence during the war. Turing's most significant contribution during the war was his involvement in breaking the Enigma code used by the German military to encrypt their communications. Turing and his team developed a machine called the "Bombe" to assist in the decryption of Enigma-encrypted messages.

            After the war, Turing continued his research in computer science. He developed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the earliest electronic stored-program computers. Alan Turing's work on the Turing machine, often referred to as the Turing Test, had a profound influence on the field of artificial intelligence. His ideas about computation and algorithms continue to shape the way we think about computers and their capabilities.

            On 7 June 1954, Turing died by cyanide poisoning at the age of 41. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, but speculations still surround the reason for his death.
