                Technology has witnessed impressive evolution in the past few decades, which has in turn transformed our lives and helped us evolve with it. Right from roadways, railways, and aircraft for seamless travel to making communication effortless from any part of the world, technology has contributed more than anything to help mankind live a life of luxury and convenience. It is also because of technology that we know our world and outer space better. Every field owes its advancement to technology, and this clearly indicates the importance of technology in every aspect of our lives.

            At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.
