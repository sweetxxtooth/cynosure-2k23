            Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is often referred to as “the first programmer”. She helped revolutionize the trajectory of the computer industry and is considered the first person to recognize that computers had a much larger potential than mathematical calculation.</p>
        <p>
            Augusta Ada Byron was born in London, England on December 10, 1815 to the famous poet, Lord Byron. Her father and mother separated months after she was born. Lord Byron moved to Greece where he died when Lovelace was eight years old. Ada Lovelace exhibited a talent in mathematics at an early age. At the age of twelve, she showed an interest in mechanics, and though it had no success, it became the foundation of her later friendship with mathematician <a href="charles-babbage.html">Charles Babbage</a>, known as 'the father of computers'.

            Babbage was credited with creating the first automatic digital computer, the “Analytical Engine.”  An Italian engineer, Luigi Menabrea wrote an article about Babbage’s work in French and Babbage gave the article to Lovelace to translate. Not only did Lovelace translate the original French text to English, but she provided her own annotations, which she simply called 'Notes'. These 'Notes' were three times as long as the original work and became her most notable work. She hypothesized this programming could work with other things besides numbers. The idea of a machine that could manipulate symbols according to rules marked the important transition from calculation to computation. Lovelace’s notes on the article’s comments were published in 1843 in an English science journal. She used “A.A.L.” (Augusta Ada Lovelace) as her name in the publication. Thanks to Lovelace’s insights, computers have developed over time in ways previously not considered possible.

            In 1835, Ada Byron married William King and had three children. Lovelace died from uterine cancer on November 27, 1852 and was buried next to her father’s grave. She was only 36 years old. Her contributions to technology were not known until a century after her death. The second Tuesday in October each year is now known as Ada Lovelace Day, where the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering and mathematics are honored.
